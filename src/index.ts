// I had an issue where

// loading the page in portrait

// I found someone else with a similar issue and their solution worked.
// I don't really understand it all.
// I suspect it has something to do with the canvas size in landscape
// causing overflow width in portrait.
// (But then why wouldn't the canvas size in portrait cause overflow height in landscape?)
// (And it doesn't look like the person asking the question in stackoverflow is using a canvas. Maybe it's not the same issue. But the solution works.)
